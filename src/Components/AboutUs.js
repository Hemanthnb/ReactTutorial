        Text Utils App, is a React-based application designed to offer a range
        of text manipulation and analysis features in a user-friendly manner.
        Users can input text into a text area and utilize various buttons to
        transform the text, such as converting it to uppercase or lowercase,
        copying the processed text, and toggling between Dark and Light modes
        for a personalized visual experience. The app dynamically calculates and
        displays real-time statistics, including the total number of characters,
        total number of words, and the time taken for one word per minute.
        Additionally, the app provides insights into the case sensitivity of the
        input text by analyzing and presenting the total number of uppercase and
        lowercase characters. This project showcases your proficiency in React,
        emphasizing your ability to implement state management, event handling,
        and create a responsive user interface. The incorporation of real-time
        analysis features adds a practical and educational dimension to the
        application, making it a versatile tool for writers and developers
        alike.
